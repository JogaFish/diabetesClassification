# diabetesClassification
Keras Neural Network classification model that predicts whether an individual has diabetes. Uses the PIMA Diabetes dataset.

**To run this project:**
- Download all files onto a virtual environment
- Download all dependencies in the requirements.txt using pip

**To use this project:**
- Simply run the code and watch the neural network train itself using the organized data. Analyse the accuracy of the model after it evaluates itself on the test data

I made this project to practice application of different machine learning models in different circumstances.
